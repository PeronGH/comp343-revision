    *   Concept: Carrier File + Hidden Message -> Stego File.
    *   Traditional Methods: Hidden text, LSB modification, noise insertion, document layout.
    *   Kerckhoffs' Principle: Security relies on the key; cover medium must be secret.
    *   Transform Domain Techniques: Robust to compression/cropping, may require original image.
    *   Carrier Files: BMP, JPEG, GIF, WAV, MP3 etc. (large carrier, small hidden).
2.  **Steganalysis:**
    *   Definition: Detection of hidden content (not necessarily extraction).
    *   Purpose: Identify tools used, potentially extract message, find deleted stego images, registry leftovers.
    *   Common Hiding Techniques: Appended to file, unused header, dispersed via algorithm (LSB, etc.).
    *   LSB (Least Significant Bit) Manipulation: How it works with pixel color data.
    *   Methods of Detection:
        *   Visual (image distortion), Audible (audio artifacts).
        *   Statistical (pixel/LSB patterns, histogram analysis).
        *   Structural (file property changes: size, date/time, checksum).
        *   Signature-based (patterns specific to stego tools).
    *   Analysis Tools: Hex editors (WinHex), specialized tools (StegSpy for signature ID).
    *   Hiderman Example: Appends data with a "CDN" signature.
3.  **Steganalysis meets Cryptanalysis:**
    *   Goal: Reveal the actual hidden message.
    *   Process: Identify stego program -> Identify algorithm -> Crack/reveal password, seed, or key.
    *   Cryptanalysis Steps: ID program -> ID signature location -> ID password location -> ID hidden message location -> ID encryption algorithm.
    *   Password Attacks: Dictionary attacks, brute-force, password guessing programs (Stegbreak).
    *   Strong Password Practices.
    *   Brute Force for Algorithms: Reverse engineering, common encryption techniques (LSB, masked content, key/password/seed-based algorithms).
4.  **Anti-Forensics & Forensics:**
    *   **Anti-Forensics (Perpetrator techniques):**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for stego.
        *   Delete original message after hiding.
        *   Remove stego program or run from CD.
        *   Use Alternate Data Streams (ADS).
    *   **Alternate Data Streams (ADS - NTFS feature):**
        *   Allows hiding files/directories within other files' "forks" or "streams."
        *   Invisible to standard Windows Explorer/ `dir` command.
        *   Stream portion often lost in downloads (less for malware distribution, more for post-infection hiding).
        *   Can hide viruses, trojans, stego files; many scanners miss ADS.
    *   **Forensic Investigation of Anti-Forensics:**
        *   Look for stego programs.
        *   Leverage other recovered passwords.
        *   Look for written password hints.
        *   Use ADS detection tools (LNS, LADS, NTFS ADS Check).

2.  **Client/Server Roles in E-mail:**
    *   Environments: Internet, LAN/MAN/WAN.
    *   Client/Server architecture, protected accounts.
    *   Naming conventions (corporate vs. public).
3.  **Investigating E-mail Crimes/Violations:**
    *   Goals: Identify perpetrator, collect evidence, present findings, build case.
    *   Common e-mail related crimes.
4.  **Examining E-mail Messages:**
    *   Accessing victim's computer/client/PST files.
    *   Copying/printing messages, including headers.
    *   Handling deleted e-mails.
5.  **Viewing & Examining E-mail Headers:**
    *   Finding headers in various clients (GUI, command-line, web-based).
    *   Information in headers: Return path, recipient, sending service, IP addresses, server names, unique message numbers, timestamps, attachments.
6.  **Additional E-mail Files:**
    *   Client-side storage (.pst, .ost for Outlook).
    *   Electronic address books.
    *   Web-based e-mail (browser cache, IM services).
7.  **Tracing E-mail Messages:**
    *   Contacting server administrators.
    *   Finding domain POC (ARIN, InterNIC).
    *   Verifying with network e-mail logs.
8.  **Network E-mail Logs:**
    *   Router logs (incoming/outgoing traffic).
    *   Firewall logs (filtered traffic).
9.  **Understanding E-mail Servers:**
    *   Software using e-mail protocols, log maintenance.
    *   Storage: Database, flat file.
    *   Log types: Default/manual, continuous/circular.
    *   Log information: Content, IPs, timestamps, system-specific info.
    *   Server-side recovery of deleted e-mails.
    *   **UNIX Logs:** sendmail.cf, syslog.conf, maillog.
    *   **Microsoft Exchange Logs:** Information Store files (.edb, .stm), transaction logs, checkpoints, temporary files, tracking.log, diagnostic logs (Event Viewer).
10. **Specialized E-mail Forensics Tools:**
    *   Examples: FTK, ProDiscover, FINALeMAIL, DBXtract, Paraben E-Mail Examiner.
    *   Capabilities: Find database files, personal files, offline storage, log files.
    *   Using FTK to recover e-mail (indexing, dtSearch).
11. **Carving E-mail Messages:**
    *   Using hexadecimal editors for non-standard/unsupported formats.
    *   Mbox format (flat plaintext).
    *   MIME format.
12. **E-mail Forensics Case Study (Spoofing Example):**
    *   Analyzing headers to detect spoofed fields by comparing `From:` with `Received:` fields.

## Lecture 10: Network Forensics and Cyber-Incident Investigation

1.  **Internet & Networking Fundamentals:**
    *   Internet as a collection of networks, ISP, DNS.
    *   OSI and TCP/IP models.
    *   IP Addressing (IPv4, classes, NAT).
2.  **Key Network Devices as Evidence Sources:**
    *   Switches, Routers, Firewalls (connection logs, remote access logs), NIDS/NIPS, Web proxies, Domain controllers, DHCP servers, Application servers.
3.  **Network Forensics Overview:**
    *   Systematic tracking of incoming/outgoing traffic.
    *   Identifying attack methods, intruder trails, cause of abnormal traffic.
4.  **Live Acquisitions:**
    *   Importance for active intrusions (footprints in RAM/processes).
    *   **Order of Volatility (OOV):** How long data persists (Cache > RAM > Paging File > HDD > Remote Logs > Archive Media). Prioritize collection accordingly.
    *   Steps: Bootable forensic CD, log actions, copy RAM, forensic hash.
    *   Windows RAM capture tools (Mantech Memory DD, FTK Imager).
5.  **Standard Procedures for Network Forensics:**
    *   Use standard installation images for comparison.
    *   Isolate compromised systems.
    *   Retrieve volatile data, acquire drives.
    *   Compare forensic image to original installation.
6.  **Reviewing Network Logs:**
    *   From network servers, routers, firewalls, web servers.
    *   Tools like `tcpdump` for traffic examination.
7.  **Network Forensics Tools:**
